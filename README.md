# Overview

This repository contains a complete dashboard for the belly button diversity analysis. An initial panel for demographic information requires the capability of visualizing  bacterial data volunteers. The new requirement demands the ability to identify the top 10 bacterial species in the belly buttons of any volunteer. This will allow Improbable Beef to identify a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef and volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
